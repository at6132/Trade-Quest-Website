            <h3>Why AI Matters?</h3>
            <p>Human emotions can lead to irrational trading decisions. AI helps by eliminating emotional biases and
            identifying high-probability trades.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>AI analyzes historical trade patterns to suggest optimal entry and exit points.</li>
                <li>Identifies emerging trends before they become obvious to human traders.</li>
                <li>Calculates risk-reward ratios and suggests safe position sizes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By leveraging machine learning, our AI Trade Assistant continuously learns from market conditions, giving
            you an edge over traders who rely purely on intuition.</p>
